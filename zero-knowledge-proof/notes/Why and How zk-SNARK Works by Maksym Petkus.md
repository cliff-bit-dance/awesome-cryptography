## Introduction

A protocol should satisfy three properties:
• Completeness — if the statement is true then a prover can convince a verifier
• Soundness — a cheating prover can not convince a verifier of a false statement
• Zero-knowledge — the interaction only reveals if a statement is true and nothing else

The zk-SNARK term itself was introduced in [Bit+11](#References), building on [Gro10] with following Pinocchio protocol [Gen+12; Par+13] making it applicable for general computing.
