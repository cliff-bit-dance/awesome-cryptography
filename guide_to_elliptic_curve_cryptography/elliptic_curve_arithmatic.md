## Group order
Let E be an elliptic curve defined over F_{q}. The number of points in E(Fq), denoted #E(Fq), is called the order of E over Fq.

Theorem(Hasse) Let E be an elliptic curve defined over F_{q}. Then
q + 1 - 2 \sqrt{q} \leq #E(F_{q}) \leq q+1 + 2 \sqrt{q}

An alternate formulation of Hasseâ€™s theorem is the following: if E is defined over Fq, then #E(F_{q}) = q + 1 - t where |t| \leq 2 \sqrt{q}; t is called the trace of E over F_{q}. since 2\sqrt{q} is small relative to q, we have #E(F_q) \approx q.
