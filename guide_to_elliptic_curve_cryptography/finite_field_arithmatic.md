## Existence and uniqueness
The order of a finite field is the number of elements in the field. There exists a finite field F of order q if and only if q is a prime power,i.e.,q=p^{m} where p is a prime number called the characteristic of F, and m is a positive integer. If m = 1, then F is called a prime field. If m ≥ 2, then F is called an extension field. For any prime power q, there is essentially only one finite field of order q; informally, this means that any two finite fields of order q are structurally the same. We say that any two finite fields of order q are isomorphic and denote such a field by F_{q}

## binary field
Finite fields of order 2^{m} are called binary fields or characteristic-two finite fields. One way to construct F_{2^m} is to use a polynomial basis representation. Here, the elements of F_{2^m} are the binary polynomials (polynomials whose coefficients are in the field F_{2} ={0,1})of degree at most m−1
F_{2^m}= {a_{m-1}z^{m-1} + a_{m-2}z^{m-2} + ... + a_{1}z + a_{0} : a_{i} \in {0,1}} 
An irreducible binary polynomial f(z) of degree m is chosen. Multiplication of field elements is performed modulo the reduction polynomial f(z)

## extension field
F_{p^m}= {a_{m-1}z^{m-1} + a_{m-2}z^{m-2} + ... + a_{1}z + a_{0} : a_{i} \in F_{p}}
